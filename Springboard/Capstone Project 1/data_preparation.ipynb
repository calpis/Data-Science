Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.

       "2       This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "5       I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "6       This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!

       "568433  I just bought this soup today at my local grocer, brought it back to work with me, heated it up and almost spit out my first bite.  The taste is so sweet, and it's not just the aftertaste as a previous commenter said.  This soup is horrible!  It tastes nothing like true Cajun red beans and rice.  I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, \"eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it,\" but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was \"healthy\" or \"low fat\" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE. THIS SOUP SUCKS.  \n",

       "568440  Indie Candy's gummies are absolutely delicious. I buy them for my kids and I can't wait to have one myself! They are soft and so flavorful. Whenever I visit the store (I live a little ways away), I get orders from at least 5 friends of all the things they want me to get for them. It has quickly become our favorite candy store! I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with. My friends who have children with severe nut, gluten and milk allergies LOVE Indie. All their chocolate and candy is made in a big 8 free facility - no cross contamination!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "568443  I love this tea.  I first discovered the pleasures of chai after attending a yoga class.  The yoga instructor made tea for us.  I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "568444  As a foodie, I use a lot of Chinese 5 Spice powder in my daily cooking.  It is impossible to get the amount of 5 spice for this price!

       "568447  Hoping there is no MSG in this, this tastes extremely good when i make it with toasted fish. I used to eat fried chicken and other chicken dishes when i was young and had no idea they tasted so good because of this spice mix. Now i know when i remember about the great aroma and lip smacking flavor this imparts to my fish.  This is also good in soups and gives you a kind of addiction that you will want to put this spice mix into everything you eat.<br />Would like to add this will make anyone eat any kind of meat or vegetable, in my case I prefer costly red salmon in a can but pink salmon is so cheaper and now with Five spice pink salmon toast feels as enjoyable as anything else i have eaten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

If you compare the ingredients, you will know why.  Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "44736  It was almost a 'love at first bite' - the perfectly roasted almond with a nice thin layer of pure flavorful cocoa on the top.<br /><br />You can smell the cocoa as soon as you open the canister - making you want to take a bite.<br /><br />You may or may not like the taste of this cocoa roasted almonds depending on your likingness for cocoa.  We are so much used to the taste of chocolate (which is actually cocoa + many other ingredients like milk ...) - that you might have never really tasted really cocoa.<br /><br />Tasting this item it like tasting and enjoying flavorful pure raw cocoa with crunchy almonds in the center.  Get yourself a box and see for yourself what real cocoa + almonds is !<br /><br />Where this product loses a star is in its packaging - the external sleeve is kind of comes in one piece, so if you try to remove the lid, the external sleeve kind of tends to come off fully - so careful when you are removing the external sleeve for the canister.   \n",
       "64421  My son loves spaghetti so I didn't hesitate ordering this for him. He says they are great. I have tried them myself and they are delicious. Just open and pop them in the microwave. It is very easy. The best thing about ordering from Amazon grocery is that they deliver to your door. If you have a loved one that lives far away and may have limited transportation this is the answer. Just order what you want them to have and Amazon takes care of the rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.

Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with.

I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.</td>\n",

My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "2       This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "5       I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag.

       "10      I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.

       "568433  I just bought this soup today at my local grocer, brought it back to work with me, heated it up and almost spit out my first bite.  The taste is so sweet, and it's not just the aftertaste as a previous commenter said.  This soup is horrible!  It tastes nothing like true Cajun red beans and rice.  I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, \"eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it,\" but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was \"healthy\" or \"low fat\" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE. THIS SOUP SUCKS.   \n",

       "568440  Indie Candy's gummies are absolutely delicious. I buy them for my kids and I can't wait to have one myself! They are soft and so flavorful. Whenever I visit the store (I live a little ways away), I get orders from at least 5 friends of all the things they want me to get for them. It has quickly become our favorite candy store! I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with. My friends who have children with severe nut, gluten and milk allergies LOVE Indie. All their chocolate and candy is made in a big 8 free facility - no cross contamination!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "568443  I love this tea.  I first discovered the pleasures of chai after attending a yoga class.  The yoga instructor made tea for us.  I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "568444  As a foodie, I use a lot of Chinese 5 Spice powder in my daily cooking.  It is impossible to get the amount of 5 spice for this price!

       "568445  You can make this mix yourself, but the Star Anise is often difficult to find.

       "568447  Hoping there is no MSG in this, this tastes extremely good when i make it with toasted fish. I used to eat fried chicken and other chicken dishes when i was young and had no idea they tasted so good because of this spice mix. Now i know when i remember about the great aroma and lip smacking flavor this imparts to my fish.  This is also good in soups and gives you a kind of addiction that you will want to put this spice mix into everything you eat.<br />Would like to add this will make anyone eat any kind of meat or vegetable, in my case I prefer costly red salmon in a can but pink salmon is so cheaper and now with Five spice pink salmon toast feels as enjoyable as anything else i have eaten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "568451  These stars are small, so you can give 10-15 of those in one training session.  I tried to train our dog with \"Ceaser dog treats\",  it just made our puppy hyper.  If you compare the ingredients, you will know why.  Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
